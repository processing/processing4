Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a programming language designed for learning how to code.

This repository contains the source code for the [Processing](https://processing.org/) project for people who want to help improve the code.

We welcome new contributors! Join us on the [Discord Server](https://discord.processing.org), and see the [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and tips on getting started.

## Acknowledgement
Processing was initiated in 2001 by Ben Fry and Casey Reas, who led the development and maintenance of the project until 2023. We are grateful for their vision and dedication to the project. Processing is also indebted to over two decades of contributions from the broader Processing community.

## Using Processing

If you're interested in *using* Processing, head over to the [download page](https://processing.org/download), or read more about the project on the [Processing website](https://processing.org/). There are also several [tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials) that provide a helpful introduction. They are complemented by hundreds of examples that are included with the software itself.

## Getting Help 
For assistance with your own sketches, projects, or code, please post your question on the Processing forum: https://discourse.processing.org/. Our community is full of experienced developers and knowledgeable users who are eager to help. Before you post, please take a moment to read the [guidelines on asking questions](https://discourse.processing.org/t/guidelines-asking-questions/2147) to make sure you get the best possible help. We’re incredibly grateful for the support and knowledge shared by everyone on the forum over the years.

## Contributing to Processing
Processing is a labor of love, built over decades by people who believe in this community and genuinely enjoy contributing to it. If you want to fix a bug that’s been bothering you or give back to the project in other ways, you’re in the right place! We invite you to think of this repository as a community garden. We’re here to cultivate something beautiful together, and that takes kindness, dedication, and patience. For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We understand that contributing to open source can be intimidating, but mistakes are part of learning—and we are all learners here. We do not assume knowledge or imply that somebody should already know any particular thing in order to contribute. Whether you’re a newcomer or an expert, your knowledge and contributions are valuable. Never hesitate to ask questions, open an issue, a pull request, or write a comment. We also encourage you to step in if you can: reply to issues, review pull requests, or help out in whatever way feels right for you.

While we assume good intentions, and will give everyone a chance to learn, we have zero tolerance for repeated harassment, harmful behavior, or toxicity of any kind. Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/processing4?tab=coc-ov-file) and join us in creating a safe and supportive environment through your words and actions.
